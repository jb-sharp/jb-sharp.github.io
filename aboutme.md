### My academic life

My name is Giovanni Bocchi. I am currently a post-doc researcher in Statistics at the [Department of Environmental Science and Policy](https://esp.unimi.it/) of the [University of Milan](https://www.unimi.it/en). 

I first obtained my BSc and MSc degrees in Mathematics at the University of Milan. Then, after a six-month scholarship, I started a PhD in Mathematics under the joint supervision of professors
[Alessandra Micheletti](https://alessandramichelettiwebpage.wordpress.com/) and [Patrizio Frosini](https://www.dm.unibo.it/~frosini/). During my PhD I studied the applications of Group Equivariant Non-Expansive Operators (GENEOs) to the construction of ML and AI models, with a focus on model explainability and trustworthiness. The most interesting application took place during a fruitful collaboration, coordinated by [Dr. Carmine Talarico](https://it.linkedin.com/in/carmine-talarico-b5904973), with the Italian pharmaceutical company Domp√© Farmaceutici S.p.A. GENEOnet, i.e. the explainable AI model for the detection of protein pockets that we have developed, can be tested on the webservice [https://geneonet.exscalate.eu](https://geneonet.exscalate.eu).

My current research interests include:

- Applications of (x)AI to computational chemistry
- Stochastic models for spatial biological data
- Functional statistics applied to environmental data

### About me
When I am not doing research, I like to drink tea :tea: (one of my favourites is Lapsang Souchong), to play board games :game_die: with friends and to take bad photos with digital and film cameras :camera:.
