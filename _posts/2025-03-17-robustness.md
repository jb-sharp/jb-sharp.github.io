I am very happy to share our new paper **GENEOnet: statistical analysis supporting explainability and trustworthiness** recently published in *Statistics* &#x1F389;&#x1F389;.

We further studied our GENEOnet AI model from a statistical point of view. The various analyses conducted showed that GENEOnet possesses a high level of explainability and robustness to perturbations, qualifying it as a trustworthy AI model.
