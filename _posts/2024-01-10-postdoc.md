On the 1st October I started a 2-year post doc in Statistics at the Department of Environmental Science and Policy of the University of Milan.
I will work mainly on Statistical modeling of biological data, statistical analysis of environmental data and artificial intelligence for computational chemistry.3

Stay tuned!
