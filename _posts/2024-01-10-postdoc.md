On October 1st, I started a two-year postdoc in Statistics at the Department of Environmental Science and Policy of the University of Milan.
I will work mainly on Statistical modeling of biological data, statistical analysis of environmental data, and artificial intelligence for computational chemistry.

Stay tuned!
