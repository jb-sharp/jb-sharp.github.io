I am very happy to share our new paper **A novel approach to graph distinction through GENEOs and permutants** recently published Open Access in *Scientific Reports* :tada::tada:.

We developed a simple and explainable GENEO network to test graph isomorphism using subgraphs. Our results show that the model outperforms other tests jointly considering expressivity and computational time.
